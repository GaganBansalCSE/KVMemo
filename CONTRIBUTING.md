## 1. Prerequisites

| Tool | Minimum Version |
|---|---|
| C++ compiler (GCC / Clang / MSVC) | C++17 support required |
| CMake | 3.16+ |
| Make / Ninja | Any modern version |
| Python 3 | For load test scripts (optional) |

---

## 2. Building the Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GaganBansalCSE/KVMemo.git
cd KVMemo

# Create and enter a build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure and build
cmake ..
make
```

This produces two executables inside `build/`:

| Executable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `kvmemo` | The KVMemo server |
| `kv_cli` | The interactive command-line client |

### Build options

```bash
# Release build (optimised)
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make

# Debug build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make
```

Key design boundaries to be aware of:

- **`net/` and `server/`** own all networking concerns — they have no knowledge of storage internals.
- **`core/`** owns all data and orchestration — it has no knowledge of the wire protocol.
- **`eviction/`** selects victim keys but never deletes them — deletion is always executed by `KVEngine`.
- **`protocol/`** is a pure parsing/serialisation layer with no side effects.

Refer to [`docs/HLD.md`](docs/HLD.md) and [`docs/LLD.md`](docs/LLD.md) for the full architecture.

## 4. Code Style

KVMemo follows modern C++17 conventions. Please keep all contributions consistent with the existing style.

### General

- Standard: **C++17**. Do not use C++20 features.
- Headers use `#pragma once`.
- No raw owning pointers — prefer `std::unique_ptr` / `std::shared_ptr`.
- No `using namespace std;` in header files.
- Keep files focused: one class or one logical concern per file.

### Naming

| Entity | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Classes / structs | `PascalCase` | `ShardManager`, `EvictionPolicy` |
| Methods / functions | `PascalCase` | `Set()`, `ProcessExpired()` |
| Member variables | `snake_case_` (trailing underscore) | `shard_count_`, `ttl_index_` |
| Local variables | `snake_case` | `expire_time`, `victim_keys` |
| Constants / enums | `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` | `DEFAULT_PORT`, `MAX_SHARDS` |
| Files | `snake_case` | `kv_engine.cpp`, `shard_manager.h` |

### Formatting

- Indent with **4 spaces** — no tabs.
- Opening braces on the same line as the statement.
- One blank line between method definitions.
- Keep lines under **120 characters** where practical.

### SOLID principles

The codebase is structured around SOLID. When adding new behaviour:

- **SRP** — each class has exactly one reason to change.
- **OCP** — extend via new implementations (e.g. a new `EvictionPolicy`), not by modifying existing classes.
- **DIP** — depend on abstractions; inject concrete types through constructors.

---

## 5. Testing

Tests live in `tests/`. They are standalone `.cpp` files compiled separately.

```bash
# From the build directory — compile a test manually
g++ -std=c++17 -I../src ../tests/test_kv.cpp -o test_kv && ./test_kv
g++ -std=c++17 -I../src ../tests/test_concurrency.cpp -o test_concurrency -lpthread && ./test_concurrency
g++ -std=c++17 -I../src ../tests/test_protocol.cpp -o test_protocol && ./test_protocol
```

**Guidelines:**

- Every new feature or bug fix must be accompanied by a test.
- Tests for concurrent code must be deterministic — avoid sleep-based synchronisation where possible.
- Do not modify or delete existing tests. Add new cases or new test files.

### Load and benchmark testing

```bash
# Quick benchmark (requires a running server)
cd scripts && ./benchmark.sh

# Python load generator
python3 scripts/load_test.py
```

---

## 6. Running the Server and CLI

```bash
# Start the server on the default port (6379)
./build/kvmemo

# Start on a custom port
./build/kvmemo 8082

# Connect with the CLI (default: 127.0.0.1:8082)
./build/kv_cli

# Connect to a specific host and port
./build/kv_cli 127.0.0.1 6379
```

See [`Command.md`](Command.md) for the full command reference (SET, GET, DEL, SETEX, KEYS, PING).

## 7. Pull Request Process

1. **Branch** — create a branch from `main` with a descriptive name:
   ```
   feature/lfu-eviction-policy
   fix/ttl-overflow-edge-case
   docs/update-hld-sharding
   ```

2. **Keep changes focused** — one logical change per PR. Avoid mixing refactors with feature additions.

3. **Self-review** — before opening the PR, review your own diff and check:
   - No debug output or temporary code left in.
   - New code follows the style guide above.
   - Tests pass.
   - Architecture boundaries have not been crossed (e.g. storage logic leaking into `net/`).

4. **PR description** — include:
   - What the change does and why.
   - Which module(s) are affected.
   - How to test or reproduce the scenario.

5. **Review** — address all review comments before merging.

---

## 8. Commit Message Guidelines

Use short, imperative-mood subject lines under 72 characters:

```
Add LFU eviction policy implementation
Fix TTL overflow for keys with large expiry values
Refactor ShardManager to accept custom hash function
docs: update HLD concurrency model section
```

Prefix with a scope when useful: `fix:`, `feat:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`.
